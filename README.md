Patrick Aabram - Machine learning implementation to classify colors

Color names data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/avi1023/color-names

Processes data into usable set of colors with basic color term labels and
and uses it to train a K-Nearest Neighbors model. The model is implemented
in a simple pygame script which displays random colors in the window, with
the model providing a label to them as they appear. This program could easily
be modified and improved on for more advanced implementations in things like 
computer vision.
